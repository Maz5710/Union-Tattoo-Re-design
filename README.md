## UX Research, Re-design and Development Assignment
As a group (four students) we were required to review and improve an existing websiteâ€™s user experience.  Then work through the UX process to the Design stage, conducting testing and iterating as required, this covered the discovery stage, defining requirements the designing the new website.  
Each student in our group took that design and individually developed our Union Tattoo website using hmtl, css, bootstrap 5 and Sass.
