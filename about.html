                Sometimes it is possible to come in and get tattooed on the same day, but we can get very busy with
                bookings over certain periods. To make sure you can get your tattoo done on the day you want and by your
                chosen artist its best to book and appointment. Every tattoo is important to us, we like to make every
                tattoo individual and make all of our customers feel comfortable and give them the time they deserve,
                making an appointment helps us achieve this.

                You must leave a non-refundable deposit for all bookings. To do this it is easiest to pop into the
                store,
                have a chat with your chosen artist about your tattoo idea then book your appointment. If you are
                travelling from further away it is possible to pay a deposit online and correspond via email or phone.
                You
                can also arrange a free consultation to discuss your design and ideas before you book your appointment,
                this is advisable for all larger scale work.

                The deposit you leave is non refundable but will be deducted from the total price of your tattoo.
                Leaving
                a deposit helps us get rid of the time wasters, We can get very busy in the studio, and sometimes we
                have
                to turn people away or book them in at a later date because we have bookings all day. we do not charge
                for
                consultations or drawings, so deposits are a guarantee and commitment. If you book an appointment and
                don’t turn up then you have prevented someone else from getting tattooed and wasted our artists time. We
                take a deposit to make sure people commit to their appointment time and turn up. Also a lot of the
                custom
                tattoos are drawn up after work, after hours in the artists free time which can take hours in some
                cases.
                When people don’t show up they have wasted time drawing a tattoo.

                There are a lot of factors to consider while pricing a tattoo, size, detail and placement all determine
                the cost of the tattoo, it is extremely hard to give an accurate quote for tattoos via email or over the
                phone so your best bet is to come in and chat with one of our friendly artists. We only charge hourly on
                tattoos over 5 hours. All other tattoos will be quote as a piece.

                We pride ourselves on the cleanliness of our studio, and constantly strive to be the cleanest and most
                sterile studio in Wellington, while there are no guidelines within New Zealand to govern the cleanliness
                of tattoo studios, we run to strict guidelines on sterilisation and cleanliness set out in the U.K. and
                Europe. Before each tattoo the workspace is cleaned with a medical grade disinfectant, then all the
                beds,
                instruments and work tops are covered to create a sterile field. All our needles are pre sterilised and
                single use, once we finish a tattoo the needles are disposed of in clinical sharps bins. Our ink is
                poured
                into single use caps and complies with E.U. standards and most brands we use are made from organic
                pigments, which are safe for vegans. Instruments are cleaned in our modern, digital ultrasonic and
                steralised every morning in our state of the art digital autoclave, which records the press and
                temperature to ensure all instruments have reached the right levels to be sterile. Our work area’s are
                cleaned after every tattoo with medical grade disinfectant to ensure there is no risk of cross
                contamination between our clients.
